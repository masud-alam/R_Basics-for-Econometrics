# R_Basics-for-Econometrics
R-Script Files from my Introductory Econometrics Course
This course introduced the popular and powerful programming language and software package R with 
a focus on the implementation of standard tools and methods used in econometrics.
Course contents were built on the excellent and popular textbook "Introductory Econometrics" by Jeffrey M. Wooldridge 
and were designed mainly for students of introductory econometrics who ideally took Econ 390 as part of their econ major requirement.
